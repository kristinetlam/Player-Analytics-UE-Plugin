## Overview

The **Player Analytics Plugin** is a lightweight, standalone analytics tool for Unreal Engine 5 that enables developers to track in-game player behavior without relying on third-party services. Designed for accessibility and flexibility, it provides Blueprint nodes for logging movement, sessions, UI interactions, performance stats, and more. Data is exportable in structured JSON format and can be sent to a local or cloud-based server for storage and visualization.

This tool empowers indie developers, academic researchers, and game studios to gather fine-grained analytics on gameplay and player interaction ‚Äî all without external dependencies or cost barriers.

## Features
